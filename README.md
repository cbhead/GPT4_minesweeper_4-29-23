# Resume Site

This repository was originally a simple Minesweeper game. It has been restructured into a more scalable project that can serve as the basis for a personal resume site.

## Structure

- `index.html` - resume landing page with links to projects.
- `styles.css` - basic styling for the resume page.
- `projects/minesweeper` - contains the original Minesweeper game (`index.html`, `minesweeper.js`, `minesweeper.css`).

You can expand the resume content and add more projects over time.
